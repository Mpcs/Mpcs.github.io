		<h1>Tetris</h1>
		<h2>A fast-paced puzzle game</h2>

		<p>Tetris is a tile-stacking puzzle game. You have to complete lines by moving 	differently shaped pieces, (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino" target="_blank">tetrominoes</a>) as they fall down. The game ends when the field is full. The longer the player can play, the higher score they get.</p>

		<p>Originaly created by Russian engineer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pajitnov" target="_blank">Alexey Patjinov</a>, in 1984, it is currently owned by The Tetris Company, co-founded by him. </p>

		<p> Modern tetris is a bit different than the 1984's original. Newer games consist of features such as:
		<ul>
			<li><span>A preview list of next tetrominoes.</span></li>
			<li><span>A hold button, allowing to put one piece away.</span></li>
			<li><span>A multiplayer mode, allowing players to play against each other.</span></li>
		</ul>

		<p> Even though there are many modern versions of the game, during the official Tetris tournaments, people compete on the NES version, which had to be modified to include multiplayer, as the original was only playable by a single person.</p>
